        <h2>Week 1</h2> 
        
        <h3>Inflation</h3>
        <p>The first chart tracks RPI inflation in the UK since 1800</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1" style = "display:block;"></div>

        <h3>Bank Rate</h3>
        <p>The second chart tracks the Bank rate (Bank of England) since 1975</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2" style="display: block;"> </div>
    </div> 

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        
        <h3>IMF Lending</h3>
        <p> This chart shows a surface level overview of IMF Lending</p>
        <div class="chart" id ="Chart3" style="display: block;"></div>

        <h3>IMF Lending Relative to World Output</h3>
        <p> This chart shows a more complete overview of IMF lending overtime by accounting for the size of the world economy</p>
        <div class = "chart" id = "Chart4" style ="display: block;"></div>
        <p> If IMF lending was the only risk factor to investment, this second graph would suggest the "riskiest" year to invest in would be 1984.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="myWeek1">
        <h2>Week 3</h2>

        <h3> S&P 500 Daily High and Low</h3>
        <p>This chart has its data source defined inline, in its Vega-Lite specification </p>
        <div class = chart id = "Chart5" style = "display: block;"></div>

        <h3> S&P 500 Daily Trading Range</h3>
        <p>This chart uses the same inline defined data as the chart above (with an additional pivot transform performed in Vega-Lite)</p>
        <div class = chart id = "Chart6" style = "display: block;"></div>

        <p>The second chartâ€™s visual encoding highlights the difference between daily highs and lows. This makes the trading range more explicit than in the first chart.</p>


    </div>

    <div class = "myWeek1">
        <h2>Week 4</h2>

        <h3>Analysing the fairness of using 'points' to compare powerlifters across different weight classes</h3>
        <p>IPF GL points were created to compare the performace of powerlifters in different weight classes (as heavier powerlifters should lift more weight). If IPF GL points were a fair way to compare powerlifters across different wieght classes, then you would expect no association between a lifters body weight and their IPF GL points.</p>

        <p>This data was scraped from <a href = "https://usapl.liftingdatabase.com/rankings">usapl.liftingdatabase.com</a> because it is the database of the USA's official IPF federation, so data is likely to be accurate.</p>
